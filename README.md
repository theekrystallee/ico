Now its time for you to launch a token for `Crypto Devs`. Let's call the token Crypto Dev Token.

## Requirements

- There should be a max of `10,000 CD` tokens.
- Every `Crypto Dev` NFT holder should get 10 tokens for free but they would have to pay the gas fees.
- The price of one CD at the time of ICO should be `0.001 ether`
- There should be a website which users can visit for the ICO.

## Theory

- What is an ERC20?
  - ERC-20 is a technical standard; it is used for all smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for token implementation and provides a list of rules that all Ethereum-based tokens must follow.
  - Please look at all the ERC20 [functions](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20) before moving ahead
